This project aims to analyze data pertaining to movies across four streaming platforms: Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+. A dashboard was created containing four webpages to conduct several analyses. The data was sourced from a csv found on Kaggle (link coming soon), and an API containing information about movies and TV shows on streaming platforms (link coming soon).
