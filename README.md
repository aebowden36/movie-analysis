This project aims to analyze data pertaining to movies across four streaming platforms: Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+. A dashboard was created containing four webpages to conduct several analyses. The data was sourced from a csv found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney), and an [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en-US) containing information about movies and TV shows on streaming platforms.
